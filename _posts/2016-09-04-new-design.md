After a couple weeks of work the new design is finally up.

It has a more cleaner look compared to the old design and we hope users will find it much more intuitive to navigate.

With this change we removed the dependency to bootstrap and we now build the stylesheets from scratch with help of <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>.

We will start adding new functionality to the reader app in the upcoming weeks so make sure to stay tuned and subscribe to the <a href="http://blog.feedrdr.co/atom.xml">Blog</a> or follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/feedrdr">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/feedrdrco">Twitter</a>.
